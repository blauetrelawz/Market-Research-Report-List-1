<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Server Virtualization Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Guest OS/Virtual Machine</li><li>Hypervisor</li><li>Para Virtualization</li><li>Full Virtualization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Server virtualization software encompasses various market types, including guest OS/virtual machines, hypervisors, para-virtualization, and full virtualization. Guest OS/virtual machines allow multiple operating systems to run on a single physical server, enhancing resource utilization. Hypervisors act as intermediaries between hardware and virtual machines, facilitating efficient management. Para-virtualization requires guest OS modifications to interact directly with the hypervisor, improving performance. In contrast, full virtualization emulates complete hardware environments, enabling unmodified guest OS operation, providing greater flexibility and compatibility.</p></p>
